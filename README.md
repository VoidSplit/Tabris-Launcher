# Project Tabris Launcher

Tabris launcher is an open source project which allows you to launch any game installed on your pc via a single interface, customizable and practical.

### How to help developpement?

Tabris launcher use [electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/), you will have to install it yourself.
Later the launcher will be in c# or c++ so if you want to start the code in c# or c++ no problem, it will just move the project forward.


### What does it look like?

#### As said above everything is Customizable so you can change the whole design if you want, but the basic design is this:
